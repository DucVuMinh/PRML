    "A: First thing first, let be no __miscommunication__. Academics and Industry generally speak on different language, even though they are referring to a common problem. The tech-firms/start-ups in question should understand that Academics tend to use the terms for the *slightly-generalised* version of your problem(s) at discussion. Nevertheless, they are still talking about your problem(s), discussing the edges and caveats, but might be seen as \"too theoretical\" from the Industry perspective at some point. Also, let be clear about __how__ you want to collaborate. _Likewise_, academics should refrain from being overly abstract, and/or over-abuse technical terminology."
